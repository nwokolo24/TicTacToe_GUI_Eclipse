# TicTacToe Game with a GUI
This project was aimed at exploring some functionalities in the Java language. I decided to work on this project so I can practice the use of the following in Java:

- Variables
- Expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes
- Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)

Many of you are aware of a classic game called TicTacToe. Because I love the logic behid this game, I decided to do some research into some better ways to create the same game but also providing a Graphical User Interface to make the game experience richer.

## YouTube Demo Video
Here is a [link](https://youtu.be/0-fliSzYR9U) to view a [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/0-fliSzYR9U) of this project and some important part of the code that makes the game come alive.


## Development Environment

- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

## Prgramming Language

- [JAVA](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html)

## List of websites and YouTube Videos
I used a number of websites and youtube videos while learning java and working on this project. I particularly like a youtube video that gave an indept guide on how to use JFrames in Eclipse. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8RWUoBcn3E). 

Other useful links includes:

- [Link](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Eclipse.gitignore) to understand how to add .gitignore file to Eclipse projects. Here is [another link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18726217/gitignore-file-for-java-eclipse-project)

- [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/98610/how-can-i-get-eclipse-to-show-files) to learn how to get .gitignore file to show up in Eclipse.
## Picture Time
A cool thing about using JFrames in Eclipse is that the size of this TicTacToe game is adjusttable to whatever size you wish it to be on your computer screen.
